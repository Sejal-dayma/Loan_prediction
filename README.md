# Loan_prediction

This project predicts whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on various financial and demographic factors. Using machine learning, it analyzes key features such as income, credit history, and property area to classify loan applicants as eligible or not.

*Overview*

The Loan Prediction System is developed using Python and scikit-learn. The model is trained on historical loan application data and utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for prediction. The project includes:

Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and categorical encoding.

Exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Training an SVM model to classify loan applications.

Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics.

A predictive system that determines loan eligibility based on user-provided inputs.

*Features*

Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset structure and loan status distribution.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Visualization: Insights into loan status trends using seaborn.

Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for loan classification.

Performance Evaluation: Accuracy measurement on training and test datasets.

Predictive System: Allows users to input new data and check loan eligibility in real-time.

*Technologies Used*

Python,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Seaborn,
